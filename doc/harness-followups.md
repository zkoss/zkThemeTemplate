# Harness Follow-ups

Concrete work steps converted from the 2026-07-22 process audit
(`doc/orchestrator-playbook-review.md`, since deleted). Each item is independent —
pick any up in a fresh session. When an item ships, delete its section here and
update the cross-references it names.

## 1. Brand-flip regression project

Goal: prove the theme recolors end-to-end when a customer overrides the seed token.
The per-component `x-brand-decl` check guards declarations only; nothing tests the
cascade (`doc/spec/brand-override.md`) across real pages.

- [ ] Add a `brand-flip` project to `src/test/playwright/playwright.config.ts`.
- [ ] New spec `brand-flip.spec.ts`: load representative pages (e.g. `button.zul`,
      `checkbox.zul`, `tabbox.zul`), inject
      `:root { --zk-color-primary: <distinct seed hue> }` via `addStyleTag` before
      measuring, `await document.fonts.ready`.
- [ ] Assert via computed styles, not screenshots: primary button background, checked
      checkbox/radio fill, tab indicator, and focus-ring color all shift hue with the
      injected seed (containers/overlays derive via `oklch(from …)` — assert the hue
      moved, not exact channel values).
- [ ] Add npm script `test:brand-flip` mirroring `test:forced-colors`.
- [ ] Remove the matching bullet from `doc/spec/new-component-checklist.md` § Known limits.

## 2. Compact-preset regression project

Goal: prove controls actually shrink under density compact mode. The per-component
`x-density` probe shrinks seed tokens one at a time; nothing tests the whole preset.

- [ ] Add a `compact` project to `src/test/playwright/playwright.config.ts`.
- [ ] New spec: render pages twice — default vs `data-density="compact"` on the host
      (per `doc/spec/data-dense-mode.md`; alternatively load the `doc/marble-compact.css`
      tuning preset) — and assert rendered control heights (button, textbox, combobox,
      listbox row) drop by the ladder delta from `tokens/_sizing.css`.
- [ ] Remove the matching bullet from `doc/spec/new-component-checklist.md` § Known limits.

## 3. render-smoke auto-discovery

Goal: stop hand-maintaining the `PAGES` list — new preview pages should be
smoke-tested automatically, like `gallery-scan.spec.ts` already does.

- [ ] Convert `src/test/playwright/render-smoke.spec.ts` from the hardcoded `PAGES`
      array to auto-discovery of `src/test/resources/web/*.zul` (reuse/share the
      discovery + SKIP-set helper from `gallery-scan.spec.ts`).
- [ ] Keep an explicit SKIP set for pages that are not standalone.
- [ ] Then delete bookkeeping item 3 (render-smoke `PAGES`) from
      `doc/spec/new-component-checklist.md` § Orchestrator bookkeeping gate AND the
      matching item in `doc/orchestrator-playbook.md` Step 4c (renumber), plus the
      Known-limits bullet — the obligation becomes automatic.

## 4. Evaluator migration to Playwright (capture + measurement)

Goal: remove the Chrome-MCP single point of failure (a `gif_creator` tab-group desync
once stalled Gate 2), get deterministic waits, and lift the 4-parallel-evaluator
Chrome-tab cap.

- [ ] Map the evaluator's ready-state gate to Playwright waits
      (`domcontentloaded` + per-page marker + `document.fonts.ready` — same recipe as
      the usecase screenshot specs; never `networkidle`, ZK AU keeps the connection busy).
- [ ] Replace `javascript_tool` computed-style measurement with `page.evaluate` in a
      parametrized helper under `src/test/playwright/` (disable CSS transitions before
      measuring border-color/box-shadow).
- [ ] Capture per-matrix artefacts via Playwright screenshots into `doc/screenshots/<comp>/`.
- [ ] Rewrite `.claude/agents/zk-theme-evaluator.md` §3/§3a/§3b + Tools lists: drop
      Chrome-MCP, allow Playwright runs. The existing §3a Playwright screenshot
      fallback is the seed of this migration.
- [ ] Raise the parallel-evaluator cap in `doc/orchestrator-playbook.md` Step 2 /
      Parallel execution rules accordingly.

## 5. Generator batch-build parallelism (conditional — do NOT do preemptively)

Trigger: only if Generator strict serialization becomes the throughput bottleneck
(it is not today — most rows are VERIFIED and Generator dispatches are rare).

- [ ] Generators become edit-only: skip `npm run build:css` in the Generator.
- [ ] The orchestrator runs ONE build per batch after all Generators of the batch return.
- [ ] On build failure, attribute by bisect (rebuild with half the diffs applied).
- [ ] Update `.claude/agents/zk-theme-generator.md` (build step + Tools) and
      `doc/orchestrator-playbook.md` Step 5/6 (serial-dispatch rule).
