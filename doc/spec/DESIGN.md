# DESIGN.md — Marble Design Language Spec

Distilled from existing token files, component CSS, MD3 specifications, and the MUI v7 static-CSS reference (`…/material-ui-7.3.1/static-css-output/`).
Use this as the rulebook when styling a component the MUI reference does not cover.

---

## 1. Surface Palette

| Role | Color | Token |
|------|-------|-------|
| Page background | `#f7f9fc` | `--zk-color-background` / `--zk-color-surface-container-low` |
| Card / panel surface | `#ffffff` | `--zk-color-surface` |
| Content area (inner) | `#f7f9fc` | `--zk-color-surface-variant` (same as page bg in practice) |
| Surface container | `#e8eef7` | `--zk-color-surface-container-high` |
| Sidebar background | `#233044` | (dark navy, nav item bg; drawer paper is white) |
| Input background | `#ffffff` | `--zk-color-surface` |

---

## 2. Text Colors

| Role | Color | Token |
|------|-------|-------|
| Primary text | `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` | `--zk-color-on-surface` |
| Secondary / muted | `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` | `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` |
| Disabled text | `rgba(0,0,0,0.38)` | `--zk-color-disabled` |
| Link / branded | `#376fd0` | `--zk-color-primary` |
| On-brand (text on blue) | `#ffffff` | `--zk-color-on-primary` |
| On-error | `#ffffff` | `--zk-color-on-error` |
| Placeholder | `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` | `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` |

---

## 3. Brand & Status Colors

| Role | Color | Token |
|------|-------|-------|
| Brand blue | `#376fd0` | `--zk-color-primary` (seed) |
| Brand container | `≈#d6e4ff` | `--zk-color-primary-container` (derived from the seed via `oklch(from …)`) |
| Secondary | `≈#586f95` | `--zk-color-secondary` (derived from the primary seed — primary's hue at 41% chroma, `L 0.54`) |
| Error | `#d32f2f` | `--zk-color-error` (full role quartet) |
| Warning | `#bd3f00` | `--zk-color-warning` (full role quartet — one tone for text *and* fill; `#ed6c02` failed 4.5:1 as text) |
| Success | `#2e7d32` | `--zk-color-success` (full role quartet — container ≈ `#c8e6c9`) |
| Success (badge accent) | `#4caf50` | `--zk-color-status-success` |
| Info | `#007fab` | `--zk-color-status-info` |
| Neutral | `#9e9e9e` | `--zk-color-status-neutral` |
| On-status (badge text) | `#ffffff` | `--zk-color-on-status` |

The five semantic **roles** (primary / secondary / success / warning / error) each carry
the full quartet (`<role>` / `on-<role>` / `<role>-container` / `on-<role>-container`) plus
a `-fill`, and back both the `.z-bg-<role>`/`.z-text-<role>` utilities and the button
color variants. The **status** palette (`status-success/warning/error/info/neutral`) is an
independent, brighter accent set reserved for badges, chips, progressmeter, notification
and toast. `info`/`neutral` have no brand role and live only in the status palette.

Chips use tinted backgrounds (`rgba(color, 0.1)`). Badges use full-strength color on white.

### Brand-color override

The four semantic roles (primary / secondary / error / warning) are **seeds**. Each
role's `*-container` and `on-*-container` partners are **derived from the seed via
`oklch(from <seed> L c h)`** — pinning an absolute tone so the tint lands at a
consistent lightness for *any* brand hue — so overriding one seed (`--zk-color-primary`)
at `:root` re-tints the whole palette: containers, overlays, focus ring,
selected-row/alert/badge tints. See [brand-override.md](brand-override.md) for the full
customer contract, the (now solid-fill-only) contrast caveat, and the per-role tones.

**Coachmark is intentionally the lone brand-filled popup.** Its card uses `--zk-color-primary` fill + `on-primary` text, while every other popup-family component (notification, toast, tooltip/popup, bandpopup) is a neutral/tinted/dark surface. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency to "fix": consistency here is **by role, not by sameness**. A coachmark is *proactive guided discovery* — it dims the page with a scrim and must win attention against it (a CTA), so the brand fill is correct (and matches Material's original Feature-Discovery pattern; MD3/MUI dropped the dedicated component, so there is no canonical token answer). Consequence: because the surface is brand-filled, child filled controls (`.z-button`) inherit the global primary fill and vanish — the theme MUST invert them (`.z-coachmark-content .z-button`: white bg + primary text + flipped state-layer/focus-ring).

---

## 4. Spacing Scale (4dp baseline)

`4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 28 / 32 / 40 / 48 / 64px`  
Tokens: `--zk-spacing-1` through `--zk-spacing-16`.

---

## 5. Corner Radii

| Context | Radius | Token |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Button, input, menu | `4px` | `--zk-shape-corner-extra-small` |
| Card, alert, badge, list | `6px` | `--zk-shape-card` (custom) |
| Chip, search box | `6px` | `--zk-shape-card` (custom) |
| Dialog | `4px` | `--zk-shape-corner-extra-small` |

Rule: **default to 6px** for any container/card; **4px** for interactive controls (inputs, buttons, dropdowns).

---

## 6. Elevation / Shadow

| Level | Shadow | Semantic token |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 0 | none | `--zk-elevation-0` |
| 1 — card resting | `rgba(50,50,93,0.024) 0px 2px 5px -1px, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 1px 3px -1px` | `--zk-elevation-1` |
| 2 — dropdown / hover | `0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | `--zk-elevation-2` |
| 3 — dialog / modal | `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | `--zk-elevation-3` |

Simplified card shadow alias: `rgba(50,50,93,0.024) 0px 2px 5px -1px, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 1px 3px -1px` (`--zk-elevation-card`).  
Cards have elevation only — no border. Use outlined variant (`1px solid outline-variant`) when resting on a white surface where shadow is invisible.

---

## 7. Typography

| Role | Size | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Section label (nav) | 11px | 500 | uppercase (`MuiTypography-subtitle2`) |
| Badge / chip | 11px | 500–600 | |
| Small helper / caption | 11px | 400 | (`MuiTypography-caption` ≈ 11.2px) |
| Sub-nav item | 13px | 400 | inactive: `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)`; active: `#fff` |
| Body / table cell | 13px | 400 | (denser than MD3 body-medium) |
| Card title / label | 16px | 500 | (`MuiTypography-h6`) |
| Input / placeholder | 13px | 400 | `--zk-typescale-body-medium-*` |
| Tab label | 14px | 500 | |
| Page subtitle | 15px | 400 | (`MuiTypography-subtitle1` ≈ 14.86px) |
| Page title | 24px | 600 | (`MuiTypography-h3`) |
| KPI value | 24px | 400 | (`MuiBox` with custom font-size) |

Font family: **Inter** (system sans-serif fallback stack). Token: `--zk-typescale-font-family`.  
Marble targets a denser scale than standard MD3 (aligned to MUI v7) — prefer 13–14px body rather than 16px.

**CSS class-naming convention — `z-` vs `m-` prefix.** The `z-` prefix is for
framework / component CSS (component variants, styled in `src/main/resources/`
component + utility CSS — e.g. `z-paging-outlined`, `z-badge-success`). The `m-`
prefix is for **page-level** classes that live in page-local CSS (used only by a
specific demo / use-case page — e.g. `m-card`, `m-badge`, `m-active`), never in
component CSS.

**Utility-class naming is size-based, not role-based.** The full MD3 type scale (role × size — `display/headline/title/body/label` × `large/medium/small`, each with its own size + weight + line-height) lives **only** in the `--zk-typescale-*` tokens, consumed by component CSS (`.z-button`, `.z-label`, …). The *utility* classes are a plain T-shirt size ladder — `z-text-xs … z-text-7xl` — so ZUL authors pick a size in one class instead of stacking size + weight + line-height. This is deliberate (chosen over 1:1 role-named utilities like `z-fs-title-md`): utility-first ZUL authoring wants short size-only classes, while role+size semantics belong at the token/component layer, not in page markup.

**Font loading (self-hosted, no CDN).** Inter ships **self-hosted**, never from the Google Fonts CDN: vendored from the `@fontsource-variable/inter` devDependency by `scripts/build-css.js` (`copyFonts()`) into `~./marble/font/`, declared as `@font-face` in `zul/css/tokens/_fonts.css`. It is the **variable** font (weight axis 100–900), split into two `unicode-range`-partitioned `woff2` subsets — `inter-latin-variable.woff2` (~47 KB) and `inter-latin-ext-variable.woff2` (~83 KB, for EU/Central-European glyphs, fetched only when a page needs them). The `@font-face` `url()` uses `${c:encodeURL("~./marble/font/…")}` (requires the DSP `c` taglib prepended to `norm.css.dsp`), so it resolves correctly inside the `zk.wcs` aggregate regardless of context path.

Rationale:
- **Self-host over CDN** — the CDN `@import` failed in air-gapped installs and leaked end-user IPs to Google (GDPR). Self-hosting is offline-safe and same-origin.
- **Self-host over system-font stack** — Marble is calibrated against the MUI v7 reference and has Playwright visual-regression tests; a system-font stack drifts per OS, destabilizing baselines and table layouts. A bundled font gives one reproducible look on every client and in CI.
- **Inter over Roboto** (MD3's canonical face) — Marble's MUI-aligned reference uses Inter; Inter's tall x-height + open apertures also read better at the 13–14px dense-table sizes this theme targets. The fallback stack still degrades gracefully to each OS's native UI font if Inter never loads.

**Deprecated font library-properties — intentionally absent (do not re-add).** ZK's `org.zkoss.zul.theme.fontFamily*` and `org.zkoss.zul.theme.fontSize*` library properties have been **deprecated since ZK 7.0.0** (superseded by LESS, and now by CSS custom properties). Marble sets **zero** library properties of any kind — all typography is driven by the `--zk-typescale-*` tokens in `zul/css/tokens/_typography.css`. Their absence is a deliberate modern-CSS design choice, **not** a gap: do not introduce these properties to "configure" fonts. To change a face or size, edit the token, not a `<library-property>`.

## 8. State-Layer Overlays

Apply via a `::before` pseudo-element with `background: currentColor` and `opacity`:

| State | Opacity | Token |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Hover | `0.08` | `--zk-state-hover-opacity` |
| Focus | `0.12` | `--zk-state-focus-opacity` |
| Pressed | `0.12` | `--zk-state-pressed-opacity` |
| Dragged | `0.16` | `--zk-state-dragged-opacity` |
| Disabled content | `0.38` | `--zk-state-disabled-opacity` |
| Disabled container | `0.12` | `--zk-state-disabled-container-opacity` |

For surfaces (rows, list items) prefer a solid color: `background: #f5f5f5` or `rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` on hover.

---

## 9. Motion

Default interactive transition: `250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` (MUI standard).  
Tokens:
- Duration: `--zk-motion-duration-short3` (250ms) for most controls (background-color, box-shadow, border-color).
- Easing: `--zk-motion-easing-legacy` = `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.

### Reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion`) — *implemented 2026-06-29*

The theme honors the OS "reduce motion" setting (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.3.3, *Animation from Interactions*). When `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` matches, all CSS transitions and animations are neutralized theme-wide via a universal reset in `tokens/_motion.css` (bundled into the global `norm.css.dsp`, so it applies in both standalone and JS-Embed/`browserDefault` modes).

- **Mechanism:** a single `*, *::before, *::after` rule sets `transition-duration`/`animation-duration` to `1ms !important`, caps `animation-iteration-count: 1`, and forces `scroll-behavior: auto`. Universal (not token-zeroing) so it also covers hardcoded durations and `@keyframes` animations (e.g. the tablet bottom-sheet slide-up).
- **`1ms`, not `0s`/`0.01ms`:** a non-zero duration still fires `transitionend`/`animationend` (avoids hanging any widget that awaits them); `1ms` specifically because CleanCSS rounds sub-millisecond values down to `0s` at build time.
- **Scope limit:** CSS motion only. ZK's JS-driven slide/fade effects (some popup open/close) are not CSS animations and are unaffected.

### Forced colors / Windows High-Contrast Mode (`forced-colors`) — *implemented 2026-07-14*

The theme honors `@media (forced-colors: active)` (Windows High-Contrast Mode; also Chrome/Edge/Firefox emulation). In this mode the OS replaces the palette with a small set of **system colors** and **strips every `box-shadow`**, which would otherwise erase Marble's `box-shadow`-based input focus rings and popup/window elevation, and would flip the checkbox/selected-row indicators to system colors while their baked-in glyphs did not follow. A single central, **unlayered** guard block in `tokens/_forced-colors.css` (bundled into `norm.css.dsp`) restores them. Full spec: [forced-colors.md](forced-colors.md).

- **Mechanism:** unlayered rules beat every `@layer zk-*` component rule, so the guards override component styles **without `!important`** and without editing ~20 component files. Colors use CSS system-color keywords only (`Canvas`/`CanvasText`/`Highlight`/`HighlightText`/`ButtonText`/`GrayText`).
- **What it restores:** real `border` on elevation-only surfaces (window/panel/popups/menupopup/listbox/grid/card); a real `outline` on text-input `:focus-within` (datebox/timebox/spinner/bandbox/combobox); `Highlight`/`HighlightText` on selected list/tree rows; `forced-color-adjust: none` on the checkbox check + selected-row check (a designed fill+glyph pairing the OS palette would break); a `ButtonText` border on all buttons.
- **Not restored (intentional):** `::before`/`::after` state-layer hover tints — cosmetic feedback, not information loss. Baked-gray dropdown chevrons (datebox/selectbox) keep their fixed color — usable but a known minor limitation.
- **Approach rationale:** CSS `forced-colors` override (not a separate dedicated high-contrast theme). This matches the industry mainstream — Vaadin (the closest Java-web analog) ships the same CSS-override approach in its base styles, and Microsoft itself moved Fluent from a dedicated high-contrast theme to standard `forced-colors` + system colors. See [`design-decisions.md`](design-decisions.md).

## 10. Density

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Button height | ~35px (6px top/bottom padding) |
| Input / combobox height | ~39px inner; ~52px including floating label |
| Table header padding | `16px` (all sides) |
| Table cell padding | `16px` (all sides) |
| Nav item padding | `8px 24px` |
| Card content padding | `16px 16px 24px` |
| Topbar height | 64px |
| Page content padding | `48px` (all sides) |
| Table row height | ~52px rendered |

Rule: **table rows are ~52px** (16px padding all sides + 13px text + line-height). Inputs ~39px inner height. Buttons ~35px.

### Input width: fixed-format date/time fields hug their content

ZK ships every combo-trio input size-less (no `size`/`width`; see `zk-component-rules/components/combo-trio.md`), so the theme must choose a width policy. Marble's choice:

| Field | Width behaviour |
|-------|-----------------|
| **datebox, timebox, daterangebox** (fixed-format date/time) | **hug content** — `field-sizing: content` + a `min-width` floor (`~6.5em` date, `~5em` time), so the field sizes to its value: short values hug, long formats (e.g. `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm`) grow to fit instead of clipping. |
| **combobox, bandbox** (free-text) | keep the default / container-fill width. Content-hug would resize the box on every keystroke while typing — jarring. |
| **spinner, doublespinner** (numeric) | keep the default / container-fill width (numeric length is unbounded and typed). |

datebox/timebox use `flex: 1 1 auto` (basis = content, so they hug in an auto context yet still **fill** an `hflex`/width-forced root — forms are unaffected); daterangebox uses `flex: 0 1 auto` because its two side-by-side inputs must not grow.

This is a deliberate divergence from MUI, whose single `OutlinedInput` fills its container (or the UA default) with left-aligned text and no content-hug. MUI has no opinion on a *standalone* date field's width; Marble sizes it to its content so a bare date/time field reads as one compact field rather than a fixed box with dead space, and long formats are never clipped. See contracts `datebox.md` / `timebox.md` / `daterangebox.md` and `doc/skill-gaps.md` (2026-07-20).

### Table-header background: no fill

Grid, Listbox, and Tree headers share **one rule**: **no background color**. Header cells inherit the body surface; visual hierarchy comes from three signals:

| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Font weight | 500 (label-large, `--zk-typescale-label-large-weight`) |
| Text color  | `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` (slightly muted vs row body) |
| Divider     | `1px solid --zk-color-outline-variant` border-bottom under the header row |

**Why no fill?**

1. **Mira reference (MUI Simple Table)** — `MuiTableCell-head` has only `font-weight: 500` and the table's body `border-bottom`; no `background-color`. Our reference theme set the precedent.
2. **MD3 Data Table spec** — Material Design 3 Data Tables use the same `surface` color for header and body; differentiation is typography + dividers, not fills. Fills are reserved for selected / hovered / pinned rows.
3. **Density & calm** — Enterprise dashboards often stack 3–5 tables on one screen. A tinted header on every table creates visual noise; an unfilled header keeps the eye on the data.

If a future variant needs strong header separation (e.g. for sticky-header reporting tables on a busy background), introduce a `--zk-grid-header-fill` token rather than re-instating the global fill.

This rule is **uniform across grid / listbox / tree**. Do not let one diverge from the others.

### Auxhead: faint tonal band on the row (ZK-only)

ZK's `<auxhead>` is a multi-level header row (no native HTML equivalent) used to group columns under a span (e.g. `<auxheader colspan="2">`). With column headers now transparent, the auxhead row needs **one** distinguishing signal so the multi-level structure reads at a glance.

**Decision**: apply a faint band on the auxhead **row** only:

| Element | Background |
|---------|------------|
| `.z-auxhead` (TR) | `--zk-color-surface-container-low` (faint tonal tint) |
| `.z-auxheader` (TH) | `transparent` |
| `.z-column` (TH below) | `transparent` |

The faint band on the row visually anchors the parent grouping; transparent cells let `colspan` groupings inherit the band cleanly. This is the same banding pattern Excel and financial tables use for category rows above leaf columns.

**Why a tinted row (not a stronger border)**: the boundary between auxhead and columns is already a `1px outline-variant` border, and a thicker border would compete with the column-header divider. The tonal band gives a 4th hierarchy tier (row band → header row → body rows → footer) without adding linework.

If a future use-case needs auxhead to match the column-header transparency exactly, downgrade to typographic-only hierarchy (label-large weight on auxheader, label-medium on column) — but keep the rule symmetric across grid / listbox / tree.

---

## 11. Border Rules

| Context | Border |
|---------|--------|
| Component default (outline) | `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.23)` = `--zk-color-outline` |
| Dividers / row separators | `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` = `--zk-color-outline-variant` ≈ `#e0e0e0` |
| Very subtle row separator | `1px solid #f5f5f5` |
| Input focus | `2px solid #376fd0` (`--zk-color-primary`) |
| Input hover | `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` (`--zk-color-on-surface`) |
| Card border | none (elevation only) |
| Outlined card | `1px solid outline-variant` + no shadow |

### Data-table frame (grid / listbox / tree)

These three are **outlined by default** (`1px solid outline-variant`, **no shadow**) — they
are assumed standalone, and on the near-white page the elevation shadow is invisible, so the
border is the only readable boundary. **Never border + shadow together.** When nested in a
bounded parent, strip the frame: automatically inside panel/groupbox
(`.z-panel-body .z-{comp}` / `.z-groupbox .z-{comp}` → `border: none`), or explicitly via the
opt-in variant sclass **`z-{grid,listbox,tree}-noborder`** (ZK emits no border attribute for
these, unlike `window`'s `z-window-noborder` — the variant name mirrors that ZK convention).
Decision ratified 2026-06-11 (outlined chosen over Mira's elevated because the near-white
`#f7f9fc` page makes the elevation shadow invisible; revisit if the surface palette darkens).

---

## 12. Iconography (Lucide SVG)

| Context | Size | Color |
|---------|------|-------|
| Inline / table / form | 16–18px | `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` |
| Nav item | 20px | `rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` (on blue) |
| Display / hero | 24px | `--zk-color-primary` |

Use Lucide icons via the `z-icon-*` CSS mask pattern already established in the theme.

### Header control icon buttons (close / maximize / minimize / collapse)

One family across every header strip that carries window-management controls (user ruling
2026-06-05 — goldenlayout had invented its own 20px text-glyph controls):

| Host | Button box | Icon size | Icons (Lucide) |
|------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| `window` (56px header) | 32×32 | 16px | `x` (close), `expand` (maximize), `compress` → `minimize-2` (restore), `minus` (minimize) |
| `panel` (48px header) | 28×28 | 14px | same set |
| `goldenlayout` `.lm_controls` (44px strip) | 28×28 (panel size — nearest header height) | 14px | `expand` (maximize), `x` (close) — the SAME icons panel's `z-icon-expand`/`z-icon-times` resolve to |

Shared rules: `--zk-shape-corner-full` radius, `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` at rest,
hover reveals a circular state layer. Hover fill is `--zk-color-surface-container` where the
host header is lighter than it (window, panel); on a strip that is already `surface-container`
(goldenlayout), use a mix-based layer (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--zk-color-on-surface) 8%, transparent)`)
so the circle stays visible. Icons render as Lucide masks (via `z-icon-*` classes when ZK
emits them, or embedded data-URI masks on library-injected elements that carry no class —
the signature.css / colorbox.css precedent). Text glyphs (`×`, `⤢`, …) are banned in this
family: their optical size and side-bearings never match the SVG icons.

## 13. ZK-Specific DOM Quirks

Patterns where ZK's rendered DOM diverges from what the CSS selector alone would suggest.
Generator agents must read this section before modifying any listed component.

### Button — vertical orient (`orient="vertical"`)

ZK renders `orient="vertical"` as `icon + <br/> + label` inside the `<button>` element.
**No separate CSS class is added.** The `<br/>` is the only DOM indicator.

**Selector:** `.z-button:has(br)`

**Required CSS:**
```css
.z-button:has(br) {
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 2px;
    padding: 8px 16px;
    min-height: 48px;
    line-height: 1;
}
.z-button:has(br) br { display: none; }
```

Do not remove the `:has(br)` selector or replace it with a class-based selector — no such class exists in ZK's output.

### Checkbox — mold state class naming

For non-default molds, ZK prefixes the state class with the mold name. The selector pattern is **`z-checkbox-{mold}-{state}`**, not `z-checkbox-{state}`.

| mold | unchecked class | checked class | disabled class |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| default | `z-checkbox-off` | `z-checkbox-on` | `z-checkbox-disabled` |
| switch | `z-checkbox-switch-off` | `z-checkbox-switch-on` | `z-checkbox-switch-disabled` |
| toggle | `z-checkbox-toggle-off` | `z-checkbox-toggle-on` | `z-checkbox-toggle-disabled` |

**Critical:** Using `.z-checkbox-switch.z-checkbox-on` (unprefixed state) will NEVER match the switch mold DOM. Always use `.z-checkbox-switch-on` (mold-prefixed state) as the selector.

### Combobutton — dropdown button click routing

ZK's `Combobutton.doClick_()` checks `evt.domTarget` against `this.$n('btn')` (= element with id `{uuid}-btn`) to decide whether to open the popup or fire `onClick`. The `.z-combobutton-button` element must have `pointer-events: auto` (the default) so that clicks on the arrow area register on that element. Setting `pointer-events: none` causes clicks to pass through to `.z-combobutton-content`, bypassing the popup-open branch and firing `onClick` instead.

### Bandbox — popup double border

DOM structure: `<span class="z-bandbox">` → `<div class="z-bandbox-popup">` → `<div class="z-bandpopup">`.

`.z-bandbox-popup` is the sole visual frame (border, border-radius, box-shadow, background). **Never add a border or box-shadow to `.z-bandpopup`** — it is the inner content wrapper and any such styling will produce a double border.

### Bandbox — buttonVisible="false" class target

When `buttonVisible="false"`, ZK calls `RoundUtl.buttonVisible(wgt, false)` which adds `z-bandbox-disabled` to the `<a>` button element (`$n('btn')`), NOT to the root `<span>`.

The correct hide selector is: `.z-bandbox-button.z-bandbox-disabled { display: none; }`

Do not confuse with `.z-bandbox.z-bandbox-disabled` (used when the whole component is disabled).

### Bandbox — inplace editing class

When `inplace="true"` and the input is blurred, ZK adds `z-bandbox-inplace` to the root `<span>` element. On focus, the class is removed and the full input appearance is restored.

Style `.z-bandbox.z-bandbox-inplace` to look like plain text: transparent border, transparent background, no box-shadow, hidden button. Do not style the child input or button separately — targeting the root state class is sufficient.

### Label ↔ field horizontal alignment (form rows)

A standalone `<label>` placed on the same line as a taller field has **no MD3 spec** — MD3 labels live inside/above the field. The parity target (MUI `FormLabel` / `FormControlLabel` rows, `align-items:center`) is **centre alignment** of the label against the field's control box.

Why a separate `<label>` is needed at all: most ZK inputs (textbox, combobox, datebox, …) have **no `label` attribute**, so a field caption must be an adjacent `<label>` component. Only selection controls (radio, checkbox) carry their own `label` — and those captions are part of the control, centred by the component itself.

Theme stance:
- The theme does **not** auto-centre a bare `<label>` — alignment is a container concern, never a `.z-label` property (a label must still baseline-align in running text and wrap as a caption). See skill `reference/inline-label-alignment.md`.
- The flex centre is **required only for selection controls** (radio / checkbox): a label beside a `textbox`/`combobox` already centres in a plain block row, so leave those alone. For a radio/checkbox row, wrap it: `<div sclass="z-d-flex z-align-center z-gap-3">` (verified 0px; `z-gap-*` sets the label↔field gap since flex collapses inter-element whitespace). `<hlayout valign="middle">` / `<hbox valign="middle">` are equivalent ZK-attribute alternatives. Applying the wrapper to an input row is harmless but unnecessary; for a column of mixed rows you may apply it uniformly for visual consistency.
- A bare `<div>` row is a **baseline context**: it coincidentally centres single-line inputs (textbox via `vertical-align:middle`, combobox via baseline-at-centre) but drops radio/checkbox labels ~4–5px (their baseline is the caption text, below the box centre). The default `<hlayout>` (`valign="top"`) puts every label ~10px high. Neither is a reliable form-row container — the divergence is correct CSS for the mode, not a theme defect.
- Live demo of both states: `src/test/resources/web/label.zul` (a "Default block row" group showing the radio/checkbox drop, and a "Correct" flex-centred group).

## 14. Splitter Family (unified spec — user ruling 2026-06-04)

One resize affordance across the app. Four implementations share this spec:
`splitter` (zul.box), `borderlayout` region splitters, `splitlayout` (zkmax), and
`goldenlayout` `.lm_splitter`.

**Implementation source (2026-06-06):** the canonical values below are defined ONCE as
`--zk-splitter-*` tokens in `zul/css/tokens/_splitter.css` (globally loaded via
`norm.css.dsp`). Component CSS must consume the tokens — never restate these values as
literals (gap log 2026-06-04 family fragmentation; 2026-06-06 cursor drift). The only
documented per-component exception is the GL transparent gutter; it stays local in that
component file with a comment citing this section. The **bar is borderless across the
whole family** — the `surface-container` fill is itself the divider; the former splitlayout
1px `outline-variant` bar border was retired as the lone outlier (gap log 2026-06-23, it
stacked into a double-line between splitlayout's bordered panes). **The pill does not resize
on hover** anywhere — MD3 communicates hover through the state-layer colour, not geometry;
borderlayout's former 28→44px hover growth was retired (gap log 2026-06-23) so all members
keep the 28px long-axis at every state (the caret already has its space at idle via
`opacity: 0`).

| Property | Canonical value |
|----------|-----------------|
| Bar thickness | **8px** (`--zk-spacing-2`) — both axes/orientations |
| Bar idle background | `--zk-color-surface-container` |
| Bar hover background | `color-mix(in srgb, var(--zk-color-primary) calc(var(--zk-state-hover-opacity) * 100%), var(--zk-color-surface-container))` |
| Bar drag/active background | same mix with `--zk-state-pressed-opacity` (12%) |
| Cursor | `col-resize` (vertical bar) / `row-resize` (horizontal bar) |
| Transition | `background-color var(--zk-motion-duration-short3) var(--zk-motion-easing-standard)` |
| Non-resizable (`*-nosplitter`) | cursor `default` AND hover keeps the idle background — no primary tint on a bar that cannot resize (false affordance; Gate-2 finding 2026-06-04). borderlayout is exempt: ZK hides the strip entirely when `splittable="false"` |

**Actuator pill** (the three ZK-mold splitters — `splitter`, `borderlayout`, `splitlayout` —
all render `<span>-button` + grip/caret/grip icons):

| Property | Canonical value |
|----------|-----------------|
| Pill size | cross-axis = bar thickness (8px), long-axis 28px, `--zk-shape-corner-full` |
| Pill idle | `--zk-color-outline-variant` fill, no border, no elevation |
| Pill hover/active | `--zk-color-primary` fill, icons `--zk-color-on-primary` |
| Grip icons | 8px, `--zk-color-on-surface-variant`, always visible (`opacity: 1`) |
| Collapse caret | hidden at idle (`opacity: 0`), fades in on hover |

Rationale: MD3 has no splitter; the spec composes the MD3 bottom-sheet drag handle
(slim inline pill) with a surface-tinted divider (originally designed for borderlayout —
that CSS's comment block is the source of record for the pill reasoning).

**GoldenLayout (revised 2026-06-05 — full family alignment; idle fill re-ruled
2026-06-06):** `.lm_splitter` is GoldenLayout-library-injected — no button element — but
that does NOT exempt it from the pill: GL has no `setBtnPos_` JS centering, so the actuator
pill is drawn entirely in CSS via `::before` (pill: bar-thickness × 28px, `outline-variant`,
`corner-full`) with grip dots via `::after` (8px Lucide `ellipsis-vertical`/`ellipsis` mask,
`on-surface-variant`, `opacity: 1`; hover → pill `primary`, dots `on-primary`). The earlier
"no pill, opacity-.5 dot marker" exception shipped an imperceptible affordance (user finding
2026-06-05) and is retired. GL's bundled CSS is never loaded in ZK, so the theme must also
set the family cursors (`col-resize` on `.lm_horizontal`, `row-resize` on `.lm_vertical`).
Remaining structural exception: no collapse caret (GoldenLayout has no collapse feature).

**GL idle-fill exception (user re-ruling 2026-06-06):** the family's `surface-container`
idle fill is REPLACED by `transparent` for GL only. The family fill exists to make the bar
visible *between surface panes*; GL bars abut `surface-container` `.lm_header` strips, so
the identical fill erased the very boundary it marks — bar + header read as one region
(worst on `lm_vertical`). GL panels are self-bordered cards on a transparent canvas: the
splitter region reads as a card *gutter*, with the pill + grips carrying the affordance.
Hover/drag tints become translucent: `color-mix(in srgb, var(--zk-color-primary)
<hover|pressed opacity>%, transparent)`. General principle for future splitter contexts:
**the bar idle fill must contrast with every surface it abuts** — when neighbors are
`surface-container`, the family fill is disqualified (contract outcome row M21 encodes
this as an adjacent-surface comparison).

**JS centering rule (refined 2026-06-04):** all three ZK-mold splitters center the pill on
the bar's long axis via JS inline margin (`setBtnPos_`). Never **half-mix** CSS and JS
centering on the same axis — either leave the axis fully to JS (only safe when the bar's
long-axis size is CSS-fixed at bind time), or take full CSS ownership: neutralize the JS
inline margin with `margin-left/top: 0 !important` and center via `left/top: 50% +
transform`. CSS ownership is required on a flex-resolved axis (`setBtnPos_` can run while
the offset is still 0 and write margin 0 permanently) — see
`.claude/skills/zk-component-rules/components/splitlayout.md` (family-wide rule; both
half-mixing and JS-only-on-flex-axis shipped as real bugs).

## 15. Scrollbar (added 2026-06-30)

Two distinct scrollbar surfaces, both MD3-aligned to the same token language:

**Native bar** (`org.zkoss.zul.nativebar="true"` — the ZK default). Styled via
`::-webkit-scrollbar*` pseudo-elements in `base/_reset.css` (global) and
`.z-frozen-inner::-webkit-scrollbar*` in `mesh/css/frozen.css` (frozen grid columns).
Passive, OS-drawn, always occupies layout space.

**Simulated bar** (`nativebar="false"` — drawn by the `zul.Scrollbar` helper; see
`.claude/skills/zk-component-rules/components/scrollbar.md` for DOM + the must-bundle
loading rule). CSS in `js/zul/wgt/css/scrollbar.css`, **bundled into `norm.css.dsp` via
`scripts/build-css.js` `normFiles`** — it has no widget css-uri, so a standalone
`.dsp` would never load (gap log 2026-06-30). Two render modes selected by
`data-embedscrollbar`: **overlay** (`false`, hover-only float, no reserved space) and
**embedded** (`true`, always-visible rail in a reserved gutter).

| Property | Value | Token |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Thumb / rail / embed corner radius | pill | `--zk-shape-corner-full` |
| Thumb idle background | `outline` @ opacity .6 | `--zk-color-outline` |
| Thumb hover background | `on-surface-variant` @ opacity .85 | `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` |
| **Track (rail) background** | **faint surface tint — a visible channel** | `--zk-color-surface-container` |
| Embed (idle) rail background | `rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` | `--zk-color-outline-variant` |
| Lane / track / thumb thickness | 12px lane · 8px track · 6px thumb (1px inset in track) | literal |
| Embed (idle) rail thickness | **8px = the hover *track* width** (not the 6px thumb) — same flush footprint as the track so rest→hover does not shift | literal |
| Cross-axis anchoring | track/thumb/arrows **edge-anchored** (vertical → `right`, horizontal → `bottom`); lane carries **no margin** → everything centres ~4px from the edge | literal |
| **Step buttons** (caret up/down/left/right) | **shown** — flat, neutral caret; faint state layer on hover. Along-axis 12px (read by `syncSize()`), cross-axis 8px and edge-anchored | `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` → `--zk-color-on-surface` / `--zk-color-surface-container-high` |
| Transition | `opacity` + `background-color`, short2 + standard easing | `--zk-motion-duration-short2`, `--zk-motion-easing-standard` |

**Distinct-from-native, but MD3 (user ruling 2026-06-30):** a `nativebar="false"` bar that
looks identical to native is pointless, so the simulated bar reads as a deliberate themed
control via (a) a **visible faint track channel** (the native overlay has none) and (b) a
**neutral, slightly bolder pill thumb** (idle `outline` → hover `on-surface-variant`, vs the
native bar's `outline-variant` → `outline`). The **caret step buttons are shown** (against
the MD3 default of hiding scrollbar arrows) per explicit user ruling — kept MD3-restrained:
flat, neutral, with a faint hover state layer, and they appear **only on hover** with the
rest of the bar (the whole `.z-scrollbar` is `display:none` at rest). ZK's `syncSize()` reads
the buttons' offset size to inset the wrapper, so the buttons must carry an explicit
width/height (12px). The `*-embed` rail carries **no** `:hover` rule — it is `display:none`
whenever the pointer is over the body (the full bar replaces it).

**Edge-hugging, no lateral jump (user ruling 2026-06-30, Option A; gap log 2026-06-30):** in
embedded mode the rest `*-embed` rail and the hover bar must sit on the *same* cross-axis line
— otherwise the bar visibly jumps on mouse-over (MD3 continuity-of-motion; the original
design jumped ~5px). ZK's scroll-sync pins **both** the bar and the `*-embed` rail to the same
cross-axis anchor inline (`right`/`bottom = -scrollPos`, i.e. flush when unscrolled) — so the
anchor is JS-owned and identical for both; only the embed *thickness* and the bar's *internal*
layout are ours. So: (a) **edge-anchor** the track (`right:0`/`bottom:0`, flush) within the lane, thumb
(`right:1px`/`bottom:1px`, centred in the track), and arrows; (b) size the `*-embed` rail to
the **8px track width** (not the 6px thumb) so its forced-flush footprint is *identical* to
the hover track. Result: rest and hover share one 8px flush footprint centred ~4px from the
edge; on hover it merely refines into thumb-in-track + arrows, with zero lateral movement.

## 16. Navigation — navbar / navitem selected state (added 2026-07-07)

Navigation selection is its own MD3 family (the item that marks the *current
location*, not the arrow-key cursor) — see
`.claude/skills/zk-component-rules/reference/selected-state-families.md`. Marble
follows the MD3 canonical treatment: the active marker is a **rounded tonal
container**, aligned with MD3 Navigation Drawer / MUI `ListItemButton`.

| Property | Value | Token |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Selected item background | 12% primary tint container | `color-mix(in srgb, var(--zk-color-primary) 12%, transparent)` |
| Selected item text | primary | `--zk-color-primary` |
| Selected item weight | 600 | literal |
| Content-link corner radius | 8px (the tint container is rounded) | `--zk-shape-corner-small` |

**No left-edge accent bar.** The rounded tonal container is the *whole* active
marker. An earlier iteration added a left bar — first as a `border-left` (which
curled into an arc on the rounded, `overflow:hidden` content link), then as a
straight inset `::after` strip. On design review (2026-07-07) the bar was dropped
entirely: stacking a classic/enterprise-sidebar accent on the MD3 pill states
"active" twice in two idioms and clashes where the square bar meets the container's
rounded corners. Do not re-introduce any left accent (`border-left`, `::before`, or
`::after` strip). See `doc/skill-gaps.md`.

**Navigation-active ≠ list-row focus.** The `.z-listitem` blue *left line* is
NOT a selected-state accent — the selected state is a `primary-container` fill
(list-row family, per the selected-state-families skill). That left line is the listbox
**focus** indicator (`box-shadow: inset 3px 0 0 var(--zk-color-primary)` on the
first cell), a separate affordance that merely resembles the navbar accent. They
are intentionally different; do not unify them.
