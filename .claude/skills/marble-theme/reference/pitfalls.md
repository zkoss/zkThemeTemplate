# Pitfalls

Eleven mistakes already made once, each with the rule it produced. Read this before any
non-trivial change; most of these cost hours and none of them look like mistakes up front.

## 1. Touch behaviour lives in the EE tree, not CE

An Explore pass over `ZK10/zk` concluded combobox had "no bottom-sheet" and that `_fixedVParent`
was an empty stub — i.e. no bug existed. Wrong: ZK's mobile molds (the `*-touch.ts` overrides that
swap in wheel pickers and bottom-sheets) live in the **EE** tree at
`ZK10/zkcml/zkmax/src/main/resources/web/js/zkmax/touch/`.

**Rule:** for any mobile/tablet/touch question, search **both** `ZK10/zk` (CE) and
`ZK10/zkcml/zkmax` + `zkex` (EE/PE). An "empty stub / no special handling" finding from the CE
tree alone is **not proof of absence**.

**Corollary:** before claiming a family of components shares a behaviour, confirm each one has its
own override. Siblings under a shared base class do **not** inherit a sibling's touch mold — only
combobox has `combo-touch.ts`; selectbox is a native `<select>` (unfixable via CSS, no ZK popup)
and bandbox has no touch mold at all, so pinning it `position:fixed` would *break* it.

## 2. DSP EL without its taglib silently drops the rule

See `reference/css-dsp.md` for the mechanism. **Rule:** when emitting ZK DSP EL into a generated
`.css.dsp`, ensure the matching `<%@ taglib %>` leads the file (injected *after* minification),
verify by fetching the **WCS aggregate** rather than the `.dsp` directly, and prefer
`c:encodeURL("~./…")` over a relative `url()`.

## 3. A deprecated upstream property's absence is a decision, not a gap

A "find missing features" sweep started treating every framework capability the theme doesn't use
as a gap. Marble sets zero library properties and is token-driven, so the deprecated
`org.zkoss.zul.theme.fontFamily*` / `fontSize*` are *correctly absent*.

**Rule:** in a feature-gap audit, tag every finding **PRESENT / MISSING / DEPRECATED-OK / N/A**.
Never let "the theme doesn't use X" default to MISSING.

**Rule:** any claim that a framework artifact was "removed" needs source proof. The first draft
said a LESS-era consumer DSP "no longer ships"; `ext.css.dsp` in fact *still* ships as a classpath
resource — it is simply no longer requested by any WCS/lang mechanism. Prefer "no longer loaded by
mechanism Y" over "no longer ships" unless you confirmed the file is gone.

## 4. Contracts must cite the ZKDoc component reference

The cropper contract passed spec-author, two audits, user approval and dual-gate VERIFIED without
ever citing `DOC/zkdoc/zk_component_ref/cropper.md` or its `ZKCompRef_Cropper.png` — the one
canonical reference ZK itself provides.

**Rule:** for any component, check `DOC/zkdoc/zk_component_ref/<component>.md` +
`images/ZKCompRef_<Component>*.png` **first**. The ZKDoc image is the visual ground truth that
anchors the `mockup-needed` decision.

**Rule (separate, and it bit twice):** **the ZKDoc edition badge is authoritative for PE/EE
classification, never the source jar or directory.** The slider knob mold was labelled EE across
skill, contract and mockup because the edition was inferred from `zkcml/zkmax/`; ZKDoc says **PE**.
Same for cropper. PE features do ship in zkmax sources.

## 5. The approval gate enforces today's template, not the one the contract was born with

Cropper's contract predated the outcome-driven format and passed the gate with no
`## Outcome assertions` section — so none of the component's actual anatomy was ever asserted.
Three safeguards missed it, including a "pending" slot in a wave-migration status file that made
the omission read as planned deferral.

**Rule:** any contract passing the approval gate must conform to the template **as it exists
today**. Wave schedules sequence proactive migration; they never exempt a contract already in
front of the gate.

## 6. Upstream codegen CSS is the structural ground truth for library wrappers

Cropper shipped with all 8 Jcrop resize handles invisible; goldenlayout with maximize broken and a
permanently visible drop-target indicator. Same root cause, detailed in `reference/css-dsp.md`.

**Rule:** diff against ZK's codegen `.css.dsp` and classify every upstream rule as
structural-required (reproduce verbatim) or decorative (theme's choice).

**Corollary:** declared-property contract rows cannot catch these. Interaction-level assertions
(click maximize, start a drag) can.

## 7. Delete the theme-global invention; don't patch exceptions onto it

The splitlayout pane-fill bug (a 12px hole before the splitter) traced to a theme-invented
`margin-block-end: 12px` on container widgets. Stock ZK widgets carry **zero** default margin, and
ZK's own sizing (`zk/flex.ts` writes `calc(100% - marginHeight)` on both axes in row mode) is
written on that assumption. The first plan kept the rule and added per-context exception selectors;
the exception list is open-ended — every JS path that measures margins × every rhythm widget is a
potential hole.

**Rule:** when a theme-global invention conflicts with a framework JS assumption, the first option
to evaluate is **deleting the invention and aligning with stock ZK**. Check what stock ZK and the
benchmark frameworks actually do before defending it. Bootstrap ships zero margin on `.card`/
`.btn`; MUI uses `<Stack spacing>`. Marble made spacing opt-in (`.z-vstack` / `.z-mb-*`).

**Corollary:** "ZK users are Java engineers" argues for *explicit documented one-liners* with a
visible failure mode, not *invisible magic* whose failure mode requires reading ZK source to debug.

## 8. Prefer a self-contained `<zk>` snippet over a zkfiddle link

While deriving the bug-writing guide, a zkfiddle link was recommended as the *preferred* repro. The
corpus disagreed: inline code-block repros appear in 74% of reports, zkfiddle links in 42%.

**Rule:** in Steps to Reproduce, prefer a minimal self-contained `<zk>…</zk>` snippet. It lives
permanently in the ticket, pins the exact case, and cannot rot or version-drift. A fiddle link is
an acceptable supplement, not the first choice.

**Corollary:** don't elevate the most *eye-catching* observed artifact into "preferred" — check
which form is both more durable and more frequent in the data.

## 9. Measure rendered width; never infer it

Investigating whether DateBox "hugs its content", both an exploration and an earlier commit
reasoned from CSS + ZK source that a size-less `<input>` with `flex:1;min-width:0` falls back to
the UA default `size=20` (~172px) and was "over-wide". A throwaway probe showed the opposite: a
bare datebox shrink-wraps to ~146px root / ~108px input, and that width is *content-insensitive*,
so a long `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm` value was silently **clipped** (`scrollWidth` 132 > `clientWidth`
108). The real defect was clipping, not over-width — and the whole test design (a `<130px`
threshold) passed trivially on the buggy build and had to be scrapped.

**Rule and its corollaries are in `reference/verification.md` under "Empiricism, not inference".**
An extra corollary: recipe choice is empirical too — `flex:1 1 auto` beat `flex:0 1 auto` for
datebox/timebox only because a probe confirmed it hugs in an auto context yet still fills an
`hflex` root. The difference is invisible on paper.

## 10. A behaviour-preserving move makes the old baselines an oracle, not dead weight

Planning the Marble → `zk` migration, the recommendation was to discard the screenshot baselines
and re-cut them, on the grounds that the build change "invalidates them anyway". False: the change
moves *where* CSS lives and is served from, not what is in it, and the chosen build option keeps
the same minifier. **Paths do not move pixels.**

**Rule:** for any relocation, port or refactor that is *supposed to be behaviour-preserving*, the
existing verification artifacts — baselines, golden files, recorded fixtures — are the **primary
oracle for the move itself**. Carry them across first, diff against them, and only then refresh.
"They'll be invalidated anyway" needs proof that the change actually alters output, not just that
it touches the pipeline.

**Corollary:** using baselines as a migration oracle requires *tightening* tolerance for that one
run. A regression gate's tolerance and an equivalence check's tolerance are different numbers for
different jobs.

**Corollary:** separate *compared* baselines from *review artifacts* before quoting a cost.

## 11. Minifiers corrupt silently, and differently from each other

The build has used both CleanCSS and Lightning CSS (Lightning CSS since 2026-09-04). **Both
corrupt output silently, in different ways** — hence `maskLongNumbers()` and the other workarounds
in `build-css.js`. Separately, `zkless-engine`'s LESS 3 miscompiles at exit code 0.

**Rule:** "it compiled" is not "the output is equivalent". Diff source against output after any
change to the minifier, the minifier version, or a CSS feature that is new to the codebase — the
`oklch(from …)` relative colour syntax was verified empirically for exactly this reason.

**Rule:** never trust a version-pinned comment claiming a workaround is still needed. Re-verify
empirically. The `!important` reduction pass took the count from 37 to 33 by doing this.
