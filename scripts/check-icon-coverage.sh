#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-icon-coverage.sh — enforces the icon-naming policy in `doc/spec/icon-policy.md`.
#
# Rule 2 (preview/example content): every `z-icon-{name}` referenced in
#   src/test/resources/web/**/*.zul MUST resolve to a real served icon class —
#   i.e. one that build-css.js actually emits. That is the union of:
#     - a Lucide name (`node_modules/lucide-static/icons/{name}.svg` exists),
#     - a `FA_TO_LUCIDE` alias key (the FA-style names ZK widget JS emits, e.g.
#       `caret-down`, `angle-up`, `cogs`, `times` — build emits a `.z-icon-{fa}` rule),
#     - a `CUSTOM_ICONS` key (bare glyphs ZK emits with no Lucide equivalent, e.g.
#       `exclamation`),
#     - `fw` (the no-glyph width modifier).
#   Both kinds — Lucide names AND ZK's built-in FA/custom class names — are allowed,
#   because both render. Only invented / misspelled names (no served rule) fail.
#   The FA + custom keys are read straight from `scripts/build-css.js` so the valid
#   set stays in lock-step with what the build serves (single source of truth).
#
# Rule 1 (ZK widget-emitted names) is NOT enforced here — it lives in the
# zk-theme-evaluator agent prompt and is checked manually when bumping ZK.
#
# Excluded files (icon catalogs — scanning them is pointless and was the dominant
# performance cost):
#   - icons-lucide.zul: auto-generated from lucide-static.
#   - utility/icons.zul: the "All Lucide Icons" catalog page (also hosts the
#     FA-compat alias demo). Excluded wholesale because the entire file is a catalog.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean (every preview icon resolves to a served icon class)
#   1 — at least one preview ZUL uses an unknown icon name; details on stderr
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-icon-coverage.sh
