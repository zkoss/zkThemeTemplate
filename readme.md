The ZK Theme Template serves as a base theme, allowing developers to make changes and create custom ZK themes. It comes with continuous/incremental compile and live-reload features to minimize the turn-around time when developing a theme. We assume you already know [Less](http://lesscss.org/).

If you just want to customize some components' looking (not all components), please read [ZK Style Customization Guide](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Style_Customization_Guide).

# Build Steps
## Building prerequisites
[Require Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) \>= 10.16

Check version with `node -v`

## Fork
fork this repository to another git repository, so this will make it easier to merge bug fixes from the original repository and migrate to the new version in the future.

## Initialize a custom theme
* initialize the project with a theme name. 

`./init.sh`

* install [zkless-engine](https://github.com/zkoss/zkless-engine).
The LESS processor customized for ZK.

`npm install`
  

## build jar file
`mvn clean package`

It will compile `.less` files and package the source into jar. The jar file will be at `target/sca.jar`

# How to Customize a Theme
This project contains the default theme (`iceblue`) .less files. 
The suggested steps:
1. Switch to a theme as a base theme
2. Add a new `.less` file to override the existing variables.

## switch to compact profile (since 9.5.0)
1. Open `src/archive/web/zul/less/_zkvariables.less`
2. Modify `@themeProfile` to "compact".

``` less
@themeProfile:                 "compact";
@themePalette:                 "iceblue";
```

3. now the theme uses the compact profile.

## Switch to a theme of [Theme Pack](https://www.zkoss.org/zkthemepackdemo/)
The [theme pack](https://www.zkoss.org/zkthemepackdemo/) contains extra 23 themes, you can choose one theme that is closer to your target theme as a base theme and start to customize it. So that it can save some efforts for you.
(**Notice**: you need to purchase ZK EE or theme pack to access the theme pack source code.)

1. Download Theme Pack source jar. <br/>
check theme color palette at `source.jar/palettes/*.less`
2. Copy one theme less to `zkThemeTemplate/src/archive/web/zul/less/colors`. <br/>
For example, `montana.less`
3. prepend `_` at the file name <br/>
For example, `_montana.less`
4. Specify the theme name at `src/archive/web/zul/less/_zkvariables.less`
```less
@themePalette:                 "montana";
```

## Add New .less
We suggest you customize by overriding existing variables instead of modifying the variable value directly. So that you easily merge the future changes from the original repository and easily differentiate the customized style and default styles. The steps are:
1. create a new `.less` file and add those variables you want to override.
2. import the new `.less` file in `_header.less` in the bottom to override the previous one like:
```less
@import "_zkvariables.less"; // variables needed for ZK
@import "_zkmixins.less";

@import "_mytheme.less"
```


## preview custom theme
* compile run preview app
`mvn test exec:java@preview-app`
* open a simple preview page in a browser: http://localhost:8080
* add your own pages containing the components to preview under `/preview/web`


## continuous compile/watch less files
in a separate console:

`npm run zklessc-dev`


# How to use `sca.jar`:

1. Put `sca.jar` in `WEB-INF/lib`, then `sca.jar`
    will become your default theme if there is no other theme.

2. Now you can also dynamically switch between different themes by
    cookie or library property
  -  Use library-property
     ```
        <!-- in WEB-INF/zk.xml -->
        <library-property> 
            <name>org.zkoss.theme.preferred</name>
            <value>sca</value>
        </library-property> 
     ```


  - Use cookie to switch theme, add a cookie
    ```
    zktheme=sca
    ```
It does not require a server restart, but user has to refresh the browser.

Please refer to [ZK Developer's Reference/Theming and Styling/Switching Themes](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/Theming_and_Styling/Switching_Themes).

# Use cases
## Change primary color
`src/archive/web/zul/less/_zkvariables.less` > `@colorPrimary`

## Change base font
`src/archive/web/zul/less/_zkvariables.less` > `@baseFontSize`, `@baseTitleFontFamily`, `@baseContentFontFamily`

## Change margin and padding
Different components have different margin and padding, search "margin" and "padding" among all `.less` files.
